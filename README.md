PDF Analyzer And Answer From User


The *PDF Analyzer And Answer From User* project allows users to upload a PDF (like a syllabus or lecture notes) and ask questions about its contents. The system uses semantic search with FAISS and a local language model (Flan-T5) to retrieve and generate relevant answers from the document. It works fully offline—no OpenAI API required—making it suitable for large academic files and privacy-sensitive use cases.

Make sure to set runtime on GPU mode, as this is a Google-Colab friendly project, for faster responses.
